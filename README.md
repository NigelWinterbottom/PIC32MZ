UPDATE - 4 Nov 2021:

I'm giving up with this example code because:
    (a) Although the enumeration completes in Window-10 and a COM port gets installed. Opening the COM port takes about 5 minutes.
    (b) Using Compilance Verifier from www.usbif.org rewsults in the following errors.

        * Failed to get the device Qualifier descriptor
        * Couldn't get count of Other Speed configuration descriptors.
